# 📚 DSA with Sheryians 💻

This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms practice questions and assignments I solved during the **AI-Powered Web + DSA + Aptitude Cohort** by [Sheryians Coding School](https://sheryians.com/).

It includes well-structured code, organized topic-wise, along with assignments, notes, and helper utilities.
